    "To sum it up, we aim at simulating the Ramsey model using perturbation methods via Dynare. To do so, we need to determine the steady-state Ramsey allocation. Our computational strategy consists in finding the Pareto weights of the SWF such that the observed US tax system is optimal at the steady state. It means that the truncated allocation `truncatedModel::TruncatedModel` computed by the function `TruncatedModel` of the notebook [Truncation.ipynb](./Truncation.ipynb) yields the Ramsey allocation (because it has been computed for the observed US fiscal system). However, Ramsey FOCs depend on the Ramsey Lagrange multipliers as well as the Pareto weights and the marginal value of liquidity $(\\psi_{h})_h$. We thus need to compute the steady-state values of these quantities.\n",

[First](#Ramsey-LM), we express Lagrange multipliers and marginal value of liquidity as a function of Pareto weights only using the truncated allocation `truncatedModel::TruncatedModel`.

    "\n",
    "Computing the Lagrange multipliers as a function of the Pareto weights using the truncated allocation is not difficult but involves some tedious algebra. However, we take advantage of the finite state space that makes it possible to express these Lagrange multipliers (e.g., $(\\lambda_{c,h})_h$ for the Euler equations) as vectors.  The resulting implementation is fast as it mostly involves basic linear algebra. The matrix representation consists in stacking together the equations characterizing the steady state, so as to provide a convenient matrix notation for solving the steady state.\n",

We denote these productivity-dependent Pareto weights by the vector $ \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{s}$ of length $|\\mathcal Y|$.

In other words, our criterion consists in minimizing the variance of $(\\omega^s_y)_y$ (computed using the $(S_y)_y$). Given our program, the solution is determined up to a positive scalar (formally if $(\\omega_y)_y$ is a solution then $(\\lambda\\omega_y)_y$ for any $\\lambda>0$ is also a solution).
