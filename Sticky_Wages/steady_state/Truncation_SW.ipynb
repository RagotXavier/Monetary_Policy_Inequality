    "\n",
    "A truncated history is a vector of given length $N$ gathering idiosyncratic shocks for $N$ periods. For instance, if the idiosyncratic shock is denoted by $y$ taking value in a set $\\mathcal Y$,  $h=(\\tilde{y}_{-N+1},\\ldots,\\tilde{y}_{-1},\\tilde{y}_{0})\\in \\mathcal{Y}^N$ is an example of a truncated history of length $N$. An agent $i$ with idiosyncratic history $\\{y_{i,0},\\ldots,y_{i,t}\\}$ in period $t$ will have truncated history $h$ if their history for the last $N$ periods is $h$, i.e., if $(y_{i,t-n+1},\\ldots,y_{i,t})=(\\tilde{y}_{-N+1},\\ldots,\\tilde{y}_{-1},\\tilde{y}_{0})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These truncated histories are called *uniform*, because they all have the same length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of uniform truncated histories is thus simply $\\mathcal{Y}^N$. Our implementation features two twists. \n",
    "1. Truncated histories will be vectors, but ordered from the current state (first element) to the state $N-1$ periods ago (last element).\n",
    "2. The vector will not gather the idiosyncratic states themselves, but their corresponding index in the vector representing the set $\\mathcal Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us give an example. Let assume $\\mathcal Y = \\{y_1,y_2,y_3\\}$, which is represented by the vector `ys = [y1,y2,y3]` (element of the `struct Economy`, see `Structures.ipynb`). Let consider an agent whose idiosyncratic histories is $(\\ldots,y_3,y_2,y_2,y_1,y_1)$. This should be read as: the agent is currently in state $y_1$, was one period ago in state $y_1$, was 2 and 3 periods ago in state $y_2$ and 4 periods ago in state $y_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will represented by the `Vector{Int}` equal to: `[1,1,2,2,3]` where we assume a truncation length equal to $N=5$ periods (i.e., reversed order and indices in `ys`). "

    "### Constructing *refined* truncated histories\n",
    "\n",
    "Although simple, uniform truncated histories have the drawback of growing exponentially with $N$, and of including some histories which arevery unlikely to be experienced by agents and hence of very small size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue, an option (see LeGrand and Ragot, AES, 2022) is to consider different truncation lengths for different histories, that will be called *refined* truncated histories. Histories that are more likely to be experienced (i.e., larger ones) can be “refined”, meaning that they can be substituted by a set of histories with higher truncation lengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the truncated history $(y_{1},y_{1})$ ($N=2$) can be refined into $\\{(y,y_{1},y_{1}):y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\}$, where the group of agents who have been in productivity $y_{1}$ for two consecutive periods is split into $Card(\\mathcal{Y})$ truncated histories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function we implement takes advantage of the fact that idiosyncratic states are persistent and that large histories are typically the ones where the agent remains in the same state for $N$ periods (e.g., $(y_{1},\\ldots ,y_{1})$ for $N$ periods). The function thus only refines these constant histories. In addition to being connected to data properties, this construction allows obtaining a well-defined partition of the set of idiosyncratic histories (which is not the case with an arbitrary refinement).\n",
    "\n",
    "The refined truncated is characterized by:\n",
    "* the common truncation length $N$,\n",
    "* the refined truncation length $N_y^r$ for each idiosyncratic state $y\\in\\mathcal Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses the same representations as in `generateHistories`: the set of histories is a vector of vectors and each truncated history vector is ordered from the most recent to the latest. The vector of refined truncation lengths will be a vector `[N1,N2,...,Nny]` where for example `N2` is the refinement length of the idiosyncratic realization $y_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us give an example. We assume $\\mathcal Y = \\{y_1,y_2\\}$, with $N=2$ and $N^r = [4,3]$. This implies that all histories have a minimal length of 2 and that histories where the agent remain in state $y_1$ (resp. $y_2$) are refined up to length 4 (resp. 3).  The refinement can be thought about in 3 steps:\n",
    "1. We start with the set of uniform truncated histories ($N=2$), which is: `[[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2]]`.\n",
    "2. We then refine `[1, 1]` and `[2, 2]` once and obtain `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]]`. Since $N^r_2=3$, the refinement of state 2 is done\n",
    "3. We refine `[1, 1, 1]` once more and we obtain `[[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]]`. "

    "\n",
    "We request `N ≥ 1` and `length(refiNs) ≥ 1`. If `refiNs[k] ≤ N` for some `k` then no refinement is done but the truncation up to `N` is kept. \n",
