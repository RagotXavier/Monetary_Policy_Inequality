Replicating the output for the benchmark specification (uniform truncation)
=====

This set of files replicates the graphs and data of *Should monetary policy care about redistribution? Optimal monetary and fiscal policy with heterogeneous agents* in the case of **the main specification** in the case of the uniform truncation (Section 5 of the paper). 

Be careful of not mixing up these files with other replicating files and they should be located in an independent folder.

# How to run?

In this order:

1. Open `main.ipynb` and execute all cells. This is a [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) notebook. Tested on release  v1.8.0.

2. Run `main.m` in `Matlab` or [`Octave`](https://octave.org/). Requires [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/). Tested on Octave v6.2.0 and Dynare 5.1.    

**Remark.** At the very top of `main.m`, the variable `bprint` can be parametrized to display second-order moments. By default, the lattter are not displayed.

# The details

The `Julia` files takes care of computing the steady state, while the `main.m` simulates the model in the presence of aggregate shocks.

The output of the `Julia` file is a file `steady_state_dynare.mat` that will used by `Octave` / `Matlab`. 

The outputs of the `Octave` / `Matlab` are the `IRFs.png` file plotting IRFs and possibly second-order moments (according to parametrization choice). 

## The steady state computation

The steady state is computed thanks to six `Julia` notebooks.

* `Main.ipynb`: Solves the steady-state model and returns the truncated model (as `steady_state_dynare.mat` for `Dynare`, saved in the current folder);

* `Structures.ipynb`:  Structures and parameter calibration from targets;

* `Utils.ipynb`:  Contains some useful functions;

* `SolveAiyagari.ipynb`:  Solves the Aiyagari model;

* `Projection.ipynb`:  Computes the steady-state truncated model;

* `Weights.ipynb`:  Computes the steady-state Lagrange multipliers.

Each of above files are commented and self-explained.

## Simulating the model with aggregate shocks

The file `main.m` simulates the model for the three economies of the paper:

* Economy 1: no time-varying tax but optimal inflation;

* Economy 2: no time-varying tax and constant inflation;

* Economy 3: time-varying tax and optimal inflation.

The outcomes of the program can be parametrized as follows:

* The variable `bprint` can be set to `0` for no model details (including no second-order moments) and to `1` for model details. Default value is `0`.

The `Octave` / `Matlab` actually writes three `Dynare` codes `code_dynare_1.mod`, `code_dynare_2.mod`, `code_dynare_3.mod` which correspond to the three economies. Each of this code is then solved in `Dynare`. These files, as interim Dynare files are created in the current folder.

To delete all interim files, you can run the following `bash` commands  (be careful with spaces!):
```bash
$> rm -R +code_dynare_*
$> rm -R code_dynare_*
```
